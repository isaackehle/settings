# Services

## [IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service)

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) are online services that provide high-level [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) used to [dereference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirection) various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A [hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor), such as [Xen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xen), [Oracle VirtualBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualBox), [Oracle VM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_VM_Server_for_x86), [KVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine), [VMware ESX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware_ESX)/ESXi, or [Hyper-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-V), LXD, runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements.

## [IaC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer [data centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center) through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code#cite_note-AWS_in_Action,_IaC-1) The [IT infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_infrastructure) managed by this comprises both physical equipment such as [bare-metal servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-metal_server) as well as [virtual machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) and associated configuration resources. The definitions may be in a [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control_system). It can use either scripts or declarative definitions, rather than manual processes, but the term is more often used to promote declarative approaches.

IaC approaches are promoted for [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing), which is sometimes marketed as [infrastructure as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service) (IaaS). IaC supports IaaS, but should not be confused with it.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code#cite_note-AWS_in_Action,_IaC-1)
