# Terminals

```bash
brew install iterm2
```

Starship is a customizable UI for iterm. This is a major departure from the standard terminal experience, so make sure to review the website before installing.

```bash
brew install starship
```

After make sure your profile contains the following:

````bash
eval "$(starship init zsh)"```
````
